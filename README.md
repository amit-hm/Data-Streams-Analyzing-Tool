**Objective:** to approximate the frequency of occurrences of different items in a data stream.

# Datasets
* [words_stream.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TA01NMOXDoqifBK_X7pnLXtEcO4sYGt4/view?usp=sharing): each line of this file is a number corresponding to the ID of a word in the stream.
* [counts.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17XKrO9Lhtsrgn8L8IRzvqmHt8o5WVVf5/view?usp=sharing): each line is a pair of numbers separated by a tab. The first number is an ID of a word and the second number is its associated exact frequency count in the stream.
* [hash_params.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BDzy9DSFAOu-Pe7P4BqKXLHjx9yozxdt/view?usp=sharing): each line is a pair of numbers separated by a tab, corresponding to parameters a and for the hash functions
